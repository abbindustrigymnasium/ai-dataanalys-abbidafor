# Accelerometer Data File
# Started @Mon Nov 16 19:03:03 GMT+01:00 2020
#
#
# sensor Vendor: STM
# sensor Name: LSM6DSO Acceleration Sensor
# sensor Resolution: 0.0023942017m/sec^2; Max Range: 78.4532; Min Delay: 2000 microseconds
# The sensor's attributes are the result hardware and the Android capabilities.
# It means that the Android may not utilize all features provided by the hardware.
#
# Some devices and Android versions save battery too much so the device may go to sleep.
# It just happens after couple of minutes from turning off the scree and it is easy to find it out.
#
# The following file provides the data from accelerometer in the m/s^2 format.
# The diff value is just a time delta between the samples
#
#
# data format:
# so we have 4 columns with values separated by the " "
# X Y Z time_from_previous_sample(ms)

# sensor speed set to:FASTEST
# units set to: m/sec^2
# gravity NOT filtered out
# Accuracy: HIGH
